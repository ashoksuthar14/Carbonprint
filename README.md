## 💡 Project Overview

**CarbonWise** is an AI-powered sustainability assistant that helps users understand and reduce their carbon footprint using real-time data, machine learning, and personalized recommendations.

🌍 Our planet is heating up like a fever — over **1.1°C hotter** than it was 150 years ago, causing **melting ice**, **wild storms**, and **fiery heatwaves**.

Every time we drive, use electricity, or buy stuff, we leave behind a trail of carbon — our **"invisible footprint"** that adds to Earth’s burden.

You can **trim that footprint** by eating local, saving energy, and skipping single-use plastic — **small acts, big impact** for the planet’s health.
